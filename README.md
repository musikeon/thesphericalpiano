# thesphericalpiano
The Spherical Piano project explores the relationship between music and spatial imagination through immersive auditory experiences that challenge the pianoâ€™s monophonic nature. By delving into the potential of creative layering and binaural editing, musician and scholar Luca Chiantore and audio engineer Ronald Ayala have crafted three-dimensional audio recordings of twelve works from the classical repertoire, as well as a series of binaural pieces expressly conceived for this project, fostering unprecedented processes of transdisciplinary interaction between composition, performance, and music production.
